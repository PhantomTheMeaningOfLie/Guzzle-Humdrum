..(Bahodirjon,Dennis,Giourkas,Dawn,Dennis's grandson Gustav is Dawn's client in his 3rd journey at Unova now as a general trainer after winning his second region at Johto after exitting from the first round in his first at Kanto)..

Dennis(laughing) : "well a general trainer's life is really rather sorrowful than difficult cause it takes atleast 38 years and 3 months nonstop that is around the whole world thankfully not the oceans too individually#.. to end it to start with countering(all burst..)..then it's said it's the hardest thing cause ok you can set yourself up for a particular type or even if you do travel this long ok you have a less to train your nerves for just a lots of intensity but you have the cushion of points there#..but here 38.25 years nonstop absolutely limitless psychic torture is what is reality#..then yeah you have to work or travel 15 days atleast a month per region for 27 months the other month you can relax for 7 days per month excluding the starting month and the whole year of catching but the starting month is ofcourse you should visit all possible parties organized else best wishes for personality development..countering#..Living Hunter,#..anything else on soundness of relative logic itself#..anyway#,then after all these next month finals atleast they now say not Phantom which was the case for almost a quarter of a century so forsaken this one indeed out of randomness they say no wonder Guzzle Humdrum is ubiquitous in duality(all burst..)..then total 135 gyms,36 General Specialists Cup where 8 local brats come up out of always underground and ONLY for the general trainers at first or second round#,36 Regional Specialist's Cup meaning you face at 17 with your 6th pokemon say a Spinda against someone 84 with an Arceus desire look next term Phantom(all burst..) and no that's not enough at all for Elites obviously(all burst..)..they will shove special trainers as well along with that that are currently doing their rounds and this mix will be general training 4,45 special training and 81 yeah 81 damn brats from the locality who gets to chose whose future they're going to spoil just like theirs revenge they say is a confession of pain if only they knew that Hands-On#..,then finally 36 General Trainers Cup you have to do where you only get to do 4 matches and Finals with 16 general trainers total but not with any of your travel companions current or former#..now you can't choose strong types against special trainers who are on jounrey the local brats thankfully gets that stuff to handle#..given(all burst..) you declares from before whom you're going to use in which round fairness look logic now Phantom#..and yeah the general training cup you have to do  two double on double and the semis triple on triple then in the finals though the second days including first 3 rounds tie breaks it's quadruple on quadruple yeah that's right#..thankfully they're only one round#..but that round is 144 minutes long just the match time survival Phantom(all burst..)..i first heard it at school and asked directly what is wrong with these people(all laugh..lot),was told pokemons learn from each other if given time,thanks experiment look theory now of Hands-On a Hologram(all un..long)..so anyway then after all these you get the qualification and ok you win the league which is by far more lenient than the hideous cups before#..barring the very last rounds if necessitated the 18 minute blitz completely unchartered territory at the most crucial moment#..then ok after all these if you win 12 of 12 leagues without Frontier or worse 11 with Frontier and fail to qualify for ANY not just last one you're deemed surplus to The Elite requirements what else(all burst..)..thankfully this excludes Frontier cause that's the hardest part of general training which is 2 year long for specialists#..atleast not Elite4s still#..anyway then ok you win 12 of 13 but go to the Elites then may the all compassion mercy you there cause you must win atleast 7 out of 12 and draw atleast 1 and hang on that's not enough(all burst..) you must atleast win one of the three regions in the 4 groups regions like you win 9 draw 3 you don't lose any regions at all wondrous but sadly all in a group like Sevii-Hoenn-Ransei which most do or Galar-Kalos-Unova that 50% do you're deemed unfit for generality thus relegated specifically after not losing ONE DAMN MATCH fiction now Phantom(all un..long)..and yeah you win 1 lose both the rest and this happens for any two groups you're relegated to truces#..so# then finally you win atleast 7 and a draw with atleast one with atleast 1 win from each group and no more than 3 loses from any two groups so then you're selected and yeah for the competition well each region are absolutely merciless league of Elite4 exactly why this criteria(all laugh..lot)..so then you get into the Elite4 but hang on if you lose more than 40% of your internal matches in next 5 years your status is snatched away at given a full 4 years maternal leave means your livelihood might be brutally limited to 60% of your starting salary at 77 by your grandchildren may be if they don't LIKE the moral entertainment(all burst..)..then if you pass all of these your finally shown a tremendous fortune sadly though neither your body nor mind at 77 can bear that torture of relativity anymore rhymes saw(all burst..)..so it's just to say you're not welcome here at all among The Elites obviously#..so yeah you all are still in probation afterall which will finish when you're 86.75 finally 5 too long years left of which#..but anyway once you go pass these all from say 14 to 86 for 72 years including your high school passage of fitness named fairness#..you can then buy a couple thousand resorts you know given you're available for battle anytime if lose a certain percentage in a year next day bankruptcy thanks#..so yeah it's upto 86 infact till when you have to be really alert after 86 that is 72 damn years you can be happy given if you don't win 20% like previously but a much lesser percentage then alas pension look Phantom(all un..)..so it takes finally to 90 that's 76 damn years wasted in life have a nice retirement goodnight(all burst..)..given yeah(all un..long) you win atleast once against an Elite4 challenger in last year else monthly daily weekly or yearly pension to one time passcode look now Hologram(all un..long)..so yeah i do have some money after all these years of heinous emotional abuse#..so no i don't really blame Lenny for the translators cause the most personal problems arise in those that are in hall of fame in general training and still you go home at 91 yeah 91(all un..long) thinking you have time but your spouse by then has become prepared to leave the mine..emotion look countering(all un..long)..so you're again left with horrendous brats who show many colours in retirement for 5 years so yeah at 96 years of age after 82+ years of constant and steep struggle finally you're free to revel at 96 time flies bye/to being thus self say hallow never hi(all un..long)..such is life that is an alternative to being hard emotion-thanks(all un..long).."
Giourkas(laughing..) : "well uncle i'm ofcourse seeing this but what about those that we didn't fortunately see like those good old days when you had to say ok let's focus all we knew was to say like our match,
1221 see focus got DONE
Feeling yas saturated the whole of the round..in obvious's hand(all un..long).."
Bahodirjon(laughing..) : "
oh Staraptor thus don't let your intellect to try to win..against what's left in rapture's sand..(with Giourkas..)..
as rapture is this..thus don't definition you try to fight discrimination's land(all un..long,Dawn.. Daffodils of Junctions,#,Bahodirjon&Giourkas un..long).."
Dennis(laughing..) : "well thankfully i started early#..and well when i was in high school Mr Otto and Humberto were the biggest things cause they were incorrigible idealists yet to the misfortune of all of us won everything always#..so we were really bombarded with ideas of how pokemons are reflectors and all little did they expect us to having to assimilate the reflection masters too from beneath any grounds#..man the day rather week Jubilee Hands-On surfaced Mr Otto and Humberto were like so incensed with everything all said their real nature has come out previously was an iron curtain cause in the back of their minds with that sort of perfectionism surely they had long surpassed the trivial customization curriculums#..and i was 2 months or less away from my first ever final that too Kanto my home region and what's better than the fact that at that time sadly i was traveling Silver Jubilee obvious Hands-On#..then i had to do the unofficial challenge here which definitely i abjectly lost#..so anyway there was a huge furore with Jubilee Hands-On being existent#..anyway i met the brat end month after failing the unofficial challenge met him at FlameFlash though#..i wanted to get an Infernape#..so indeed went there giving up my sanity of education anyway(all burst..) so then i go and after a long struggle get a Monferno and i was using my Delphox who was my starter again afterwards i realized not at all a wise decision especially not this one#.. not with the annotated brats all tried to make them reach there and so abjectly failed as choice is only decision if random,countering(all un..long)..anyway#..then ok i was injured myself in the process and all so i just ho to take some rest at FormFor point centre at night where at midnight there's a clamour Jubilee Hands-On is roaming around the complex inside that is#..then we all go and he didn't say anything just kept silent then some blocked his road all 4 side sat down.. direction Hands-on(all un..long)..so all were so frustrated and all then all calmed down being compelled when this brat stood up and said Fire..reflection Hands-On(all un..long)..so i saw the whole mess and understood till i want to win with this sort of menaces around there will always be a pokemon mine or opponent who will misbehave#..anyhow so i went off next i somehow win Kanto then after a day of uphill psychological struggle i return to my stay where it's noted that tomorrow if i don't go to the official ceremony my title will be confiscated as not required for journeys(all burst..)..so i have to go thankfully i met other half there atleast..which later was told by Gustie as,intention look wanting now Phantom(all un..long)..anyway then Mr Otto and Humberto drew their final which i saw that day itself that was a very strange phenomena then cause it was very rare that draws took place due to the fact that the tie breaking process was extremely complex#..anyway there still is a draw cumulative calculations said both of them must be champs which they there itself declared to be the best possible result later they regretted it so much when it became according to mood of the opponents if they knew what they were doing was the Phantom of Cuing,countering(all un..)..anyway then finally i return home and all then next month Jolly On-Roam comes up who since then to now has been the most mysterious creature among them cause is most normal till you allow yourself to be indeed the moment you're assured of this you'll be swatted away to epistemological bounty(all burst..)..anyway then i'm to decided which will be my 2nd journey i was thinking ok either Johto or Hoenn if my friends taunt me Johto else Hoenn where else for sanity#..then all is set after 2 months i want to register for Hoenn they did taunt but not enough cause i was single then to all just not on call#..so ok i want to go out when it was September the start month so on 5th i must be present at Hoenn thus i went out on 2nd ok all good till i reach airport and it says suddenly that very day itself that all flights will only cross South Pasio Ocean without allowing anyone to deboard in-between unless obviously being kicked out#..so there's a huge fuss around there but all settled and even general government officials abated after hearing this the Military strictly said because Pallet Ridge is really alive at the time strange creatures were being seen but all said it happened after someone from Pewter challenged of all beings Jubilee Hands-On to show how to train non-self the word was(all un..long)..all were cursing the Military saying guillotine the brat immediately Hands-On what are you thinking of huh#,the reply was when we told the brat who is 1.5 told us yeah Hands-On else there's no self only feeling in duh isn't it ok this is fool's courage but next moment suddenly we find around him there are 2 Solrocks whose very disposition told us not to understand them else their glee will make us non self to description..that feeling of incision we were told by this spoilt brat that such said Jubilee..shuu..Hands-On#..so we knew life as we know it isn't really what it is at all we're looking only sensing it..shuu..an independent yet self reflected thought told us..moment now Random#..so all there at airport were like a volcano those who had serious matters so it was an absolute mayhem but i didn't cancel my flight cause this sinister thought grasped my mind that#..hmm..Pokemon Master..hmm#..this is only Silver Jubilee sonny where no pseudo-legends are found and you're claiming your mastery over esoteric legends like i tell you this name was suggested to me Suruptisomonosatibom(all burst..)..so i automatically searched up this name and atleast a million research papers were shoved down my throat by the system connection#..so after reading two lines of Professor Oak's famous paper on Suruptisomonosatibom i suddenly like woke up and thought what in the world am i doing i'm already a champ get the hell of of this demonic profession of unearthing horrendously headless brats that aren't even typed#..so i was determined to delay my journey which was so obvious but what felt like eternity someone who was to attend her ailing husband remonstrated just beside me that hey why after all these only 2 hours has passed someone there itself told none knows who but that voice all knew was new said as if time mere Phantom(all un..long)..later we came to know about Jolly On-Roam who said that along with many other things at many other places#..so then all recalled the words that it was an opportunity rather than specificity(all un..long)..so all instantly said we're going to Unova no trouble and no it's true all took 3 hours delay only total from Military intervention at Pallet Ridge to Pewter to this 5 hours..moments look causality's Hologram..perception..boom(all un..long,..Bahodirjon..Critical Pat,all un..long)..exactly what we should've been cautious of#..but within next hour suddenly Military says all clear if you still want to go to Unova come tomorrow there will be a lots of jets sanctioned#..and after this there was another melee to which the Military said don't fool yourselves while we were readjusting ourselves the Johto Military said why are you charging us we were like so anxious but they were so friendly said no suddenly there were charges but our bots and your bots didn't touch the others only exchanged places at this and this area which they themselves told us but your group said didn't tell you cause it was a prank of formation then both sets said..necessity Hands-On(all un..long)..so all were like so aghast yet happy as if this isn't dream then what is reality rhymes saw(all burst..)..anyway#..by then that sinister thought reappeared in my mind omnipresent that hmm..pokemon master..hmm..this is only Pallet Ridge sonny you think you know legends they're only happy what if they asked you if they were here how can you deem yourself without a fight of own vs shown as being happy hum(all un..long,..Giourkas..Jolly On-Roam,all un..long)..so#..i somehow contacted the airport and all and said i'm going to Unova and many people did go and as i did but they just wanted to check the reality and all countering the Obviously made soul the sole of all(all un..long,..Dawn..Reality..shuu..Checked,all un..long),so#..then i went and then only i came back to psychological senses that i texted and told all that i was going to Hoenn only but ended up at Unova#..the only exception affirmed me of my full relations human that is#..cause i didn't call only sent a voice message just going to Unova there's a reply,Validation of Qualia as Hands-On says as i read yeah why would you bother to specify space then don't waste my efforts as hands-on says against time(all un..long)..so i knew end is neigh#..anyway by then many people came up and surrounded me i was a Kanto champ and played a prank on the whole world so i could only manage it hands-on thus showed my pride challenging my ego to be manifested else gone just to the corner of mine that speech i tell you was spontaneous..shuu..thus look including thus..Hands-On#..so all now accused me of colluding with Hands-On and so on#..anyway then things happen and i win Unova with much changes to my methods and all many trainers did had to cause it was revealed that those who got a fire type that first month all have gone to the bushes of Hands-On wait impossible unless Hands-On,countering(all un..long)..so finally all crucified Mr Levon for(laughing)..not changing the name of the Circle(all un..long)..anyway then throughout Unova who are known as obstinate romantics and thus traditionalists viciously remonstrated against the new looming methods which became evident and almost changed being very well refined barring the idea of Hands-On just as felt#..so anyway then i was one of the forerunners of the new methods part one Saku said i only learnt part two and so on#..so my unofficial challenges were made insurmountable almost as definitely a few Hall of Famers came under disguise#..so i win that region somehow and all then among all these the new methods were backfiring as much so obviously all understood why Doctor Slate and his following invaded all things that can be felt or has properties of thus#..atleast Daisy was comprehensive more#..but then i return this time there's a whole different celebration#..anyway i get involuted and all officially#..then next region is Ransei means i have to face Mr Humberto Rafolrat then a 4 league champ chronology wise Sinnoh,Kalos,Unova,Johto with 100% records including that draw absolutely and all said we riot if he loses due to procedural nonsense#..he was so popular in Unova-Kalos region Mr Otto here at Kanto-Pasio the other two were vengefully looking at everyone including themselves with jealousy added for future#..while later it was said jealousy and vengeance for future means they are merely there alas past of tense's discriminating suture..countering Hands-On#..so#..it was told that unless things are Hands-On it's called#..empty of execution(all un..long..),anyway#..so the whole world like completely changed in no time but still it was a mere jerk the real stuff happened when firstly it was proved that so called human physique can be best optimized at 18ft 1626kgs Hands-On#..then with that the ideas the whole existence like Fruit just Juice# that really carried the flame to the haystack till Onto Murmur took over as it's now but Conscious Precious as said is outright impossible to feel even unless in that feeling..countering of self Hands-On(all burst..)..anyway one of the notes is that Saku all said misbehaved having won the first league i said i did far worse 13 years back she only irritated you didn't play a prank of Hands-On..shuu.. impossible unless Hands-On(all un..long)..so yeah Mr Levon did admit after Stashey boy debuted that he should've changed the name of being too to Humdrum of Ing#..then anyway Mr Humberto and Otto still went ahead with their methods and their brats behaved exactly as Dawnny's brats do#..so then in the meantime Lily was came up who was too everhappy always and all so yeah all were still ok Doctor Slate and gang settled down after 5 years of revolution against meaning of same#..for 6 months but something told us that a far worse fate is awaiting us#..and man it was a mayhem the first time Kuchi was found at Frucifern#..then Dr Oak and rest unleashed as a reaction of the mass#..but still nothing can ever tarnish not even Guzzle Humdrum that day first time ever all thought actually may be there's some calmness in there too but that day on top of the most notorious Volcano of the Pallet Ridge ring at Juritared with that mythically haunted gym when cross-arm defense came up(all un..)..man that's filmed still start to end#..no wonder the group that shot it spent 3 months as being psychologically surplus to humanity#..but that stuff Dawnny knows best Gustie said it's been 40 years now still no movies ever touched it#.."
Dawn(laughing..) : "well i couldn't catch up with Shadowy Lantern and Connect Destination# in 3 days so i was demoted to Lastly Phantom and Noble Discerned#..who referred me to everyone lastly from Guzzle Humdrum i went at the hands of Orrie finally who referred my case to Quill Gunning i didn't understand which hell this was cause this brat is unlisted(all burst..,..Giourkas..Incision Cyclic,#)..man i bore the full burnt of this hideous creature of actuality a mere teenager still fresh out of semi-backlog papers#..anyway it took like 3 days only though total 7 since my admittance and no all were at Ramahati at different points i got one hour with each which i after the week understood atleast a millenia exactly why i couldn't match up with Devout Ration and Shadowy Lantern cause they threw me beyond time from word go i was like expecting some methods to practice#..so anyway Orrie i spoke with little he wasn't interested in specificity as you know he was never found thinking only one thing at any time(all un..long,.. Giourkas..Refill Concern,#)..so he only told me in one hour to stay quietly breath in and out just as i did with the addition that think about thought if only you fail contact me at the end of ALL..essence thus refill now concern(all un..long)..so i did do that and succeeded thankfully(all un..long,..Bahodirjon..Proven Umpteen,#)..exactly why#..so then i was referred to Quill Gunning lastly#..whom i knew least about cause barring with Ole this brat was unlisted his works were very few and he only reiterated Ole whose popularity is 2nd only to obviously Simile Popcorn who was Co-Ordinator#..third was lastly Phantom fourth was Dr Oak and Lillie flower tied none of whom anyone knew why bothered to epitomise like Lillie flower(all laugh..lot)..so anyway i was forced into his stay which was obviously a tree at Ricordiv Oasis but he was sitting on a branch swinging his legs when saw me coming did so at me(all un..long)..so i thought may be this isn't whom i'm supposed to meet(all burst..,Bahodirjon..Incision Cyclic,all un..long)..so i go underneath and said um..i'm Dawn yo..,shuuu..name..silence else look circles Hands-On..the most reactive Quill now Hunts-On..countering incision the most ending(all un..long,..Bahodirjon..Quill Gunning,#),so i obviously didn't know anything about their previous works so i said um..excuse me but um.. shouldn't you admit that you're trying to um..like..um..remain(all un..long,.. Giourkas..Lady Dawn Groudon,#)..atleast i didn't ask them like if i could correspond or collaborate to or with them(all un..long,Giourkas too un..long)..anyway the reply is(laughing..)..

Giourkas too un..).."
Giourkas(laughing..) : "well none have ever won any league or contest or any frontiers continuous with full 100% win record in each round not one blemish and even better is without ever taking the full time in any of the rounds always atleast 44 or atmost 46 seconds to spare no other numbers either#..Bahodirjon..Lady Dawn Baby Dawnny"
