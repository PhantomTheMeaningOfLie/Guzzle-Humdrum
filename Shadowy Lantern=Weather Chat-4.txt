un..)\"\r\nZed(smile) : \"well when i came around first this idea of work came..but to do that i had to optimize it compeer amidst intelligbility to make my own name(all un..long)..thus later i saw so many times spontaneity is the crux of the game..that this idea to be unanimous compeer has made my self to another the excuse to be lame(all un..long)..rationally else what you wanted is to pierce through my body and see if it's not you or you but do to your limits of being only me compeer see how i got this whole situation messed up just to have a self of the meaning of name(all un..long)..name : the unequivocal if alas now tamed(all un..long)..by something else compeer but name in itself doesn't divide this what does is the lexicon,lexicon : the clamour of meanings just to have a name..the most piercing(all un..long)..why the slangs hit hard compeer is because physique and mind and emotion and consciousness is none of your's but you work so hard to maintain them against the others but they are another compeers this is why you're sad..just for the sake of a claim..the most understanding(all un..long)..you see action is strange indeed cause it arises from a blackbox of survival the algorithm says to survive philosophy asks who survives and you can't answer at all except reflection upon what is is that makes survival possible what are you surviving against compeers and you can go on till you find your answer in objectivity or reality but my question is in the end you're only coming to me isn't it if you have to be Hands-On..intellectually the most bypassing(all un..)..thus it has got nothing to do with your needs your requirements and so on compeers it's my survival against myself cause that's what needs to survive not me compeers why and how can i survive how can i know me compeer only my self Hands-On(all un..)..thus being is difficult seeing so even more but their usage is null unless i can do so Hands-On then they are present their usage is just to know the same for me for themselves they are same if they never were to me that's only Hands-On(all un..)..thus i can't survive compeer at all unless i counter my existence with consciousness and i can't be compeer among you all unless i corroborate to consciousness with existence thus if i have to be myself really the only way for me is to be Hands-On..functionally the most enclosed analogically the most disclosed thus categorically most consoled to the interface of meaning - lexically to NEED the most sold(all un..)..thus what i really need is what you mean and that's only Hands-On on as i can he seen fare enough ends the life Hands-On death thus is just a pun isn't it how can't it too be just Hands-On thus compeer..no difference no limits no bondage no appearing gimmicks no bias no requirement no soul only endowment..the most interrogating(all un..)..sometimes there's fear compeer what if i'm wrong what if what i just said doesn't sound right for my own song of logic compeers is there really a need or fear of any if it's Hands-On(all un..)..thus here this lexicon compeers this intrigues me compeers i asked if myself what does self mean i will look at my being of the questioner already contradicting the question yet is empty but if i ask for the meanings furthermore i gets selves for them including me compeer the first question in the last answer for both to be so..the most engulfing(all un..)..again as i said i'm stuttering in FEAR to be decimates psychologically and also physically which is the only logic against survival of emotions compeer what does it mean if there's none else but that nothingness's ness would throw you back to me again compeers there's nothing you can do about it as far as you're measuring me compeers hence i tell you you should be free possible again see only Hands-On(all laugh..lot)..but here i can look up this lexicon : the collection of continuation..countering Hands-On(all un..)..as it records all the mraning and isn't bounded by the same feelings compeer how can i know anything me or not me unless they're Hands-On(all un..)..thus this voidness may the all pervading compassion hold your hands to walk through of discretion meaning indeed not reflecting thus not is sought..the most astounding(all un..)..this is cause you need to saved from me compeers if you're to be Hands-On..the most suffocating(all un..long)..as this fear of others grip your self for themselves never for you all i see is a counter compeers of I on my just to say who's who(all un..long)..the most compassionate(all un..)..and this maddening tune compeers of all unanimity meaning as a counter is the most engulfing indeed compeers in counters..how can you say me if i become Hands-On compeers..the most countering (all un..long,..Jubilee Hands-On,all un..)..try to know me and it's your and if yours it's mine and it's always you and me compeer unless either are Hands-On but if both are which we should be then how can't it not be just the lexicon : the most meaningful(all un..long)..again we reflect back to i compeer,I : the folklore of meaning(all un..)..the most important though to reality : just that feeling(all un..,..Leading Rock,all un..long,Brock slaps..)..again thus if Hands-On it's the same illusion of another and same delusion of i compeers..just to be though-countering(all un..long)..hence this your want that you want to be satisfied by me works the other way around always thus my pain and suffering or elation and jubilance or neutrality and grace only makes you compeer not me Hands-On..the most self-centric thus the moment you think of you you'll be reverting back to me to ask of you if you were against those or for your own satiation compeers Hands-On(all un..long)..if you're neutral then you can't do anything at all as i surround you all over compeer how else can your self be so different to me Hands-On(all un..)..for me i can't be neutral you see i need you compeers to go beyond Hands-On i need you to be construing Hands-On through lexicon but i just don't need you Hands-On compeer and you the same unless though you want to be Hands-On..this want is against thus being Hands-On..the most maddening (all un..)..these usage compeers of meanings rather than words is what makes this idea of all pervading compassion so maddening compeer a game of see-saw a helm of incision on only Hands-On and it's so Hands-On itself compeer where your incision apply within itself thus i said who's who compeer you or me.. Hands-On..the most intriguing thus this Lexicon : Meaning - Hands-On(all un..long,Cedar..compendium,all un..long)..thus for your questions indeed i know your availability to consequences what you want in the end us satiation but what you get is the decision that you can survive now against something compeer that's only I how can you find satisfaction thus i said Hands-On barring the meaning never in Lexicon : the most recursive to relational con against the pro if it's own existence compeers that it's only Hands-On thus no recursion..countering thus..Hands-On(all un..long)..hence these ideas are intriguing compeers and their self the me : the i of lexicon- Hands-On(all un..long)..\"\r\nPerson2(a bit discomforted) : \"um..no you should go home it's um..too deep into morning now(all

should ask this question after she's gone may be tomorrow and no more can i say except that she wasn't involved in profession then her bunch wasn't there with her she was doing some nasty things

Tirrison did travel finally with you all at Sinnoh but you were refused at 2 whole regions the second of which is very difficult to comprehend from our part on their actions throughout(all laugh..lot)\"\nDawn(straight) : \"all of our cases were opportunities and there's a trend in recent times to take Mrs Rarcia for granted i'm sure we all know her full career right especially the Kanto League final and the Elite4 challenge and what her current official rank is and the fact that she along with her other half who is also in all time HoF and also saw out undercover and lived for Unovan Bushes reloaded(all laugh..lot) they have personally been selected as vice head and personal secretary by Marc The Mr Litman..rest unnecessary(all laugh..lot,Iris..no Mr and Mrs Rarcia when you finish your sentences don't say that's all say this is the gist of what i feel as else it makes you preempt from the conversation cause you can't add further you're neither concentrated to listen nor to finish nor interested to go further in the subject compeers once my Scizor failed to provide a trap only a coy due this not understanding this thus lost 3 rounds you know despite the toss of starting the plan,all un..long,Iris..Marc the Mr Litman no more options required,all un..)..\"\nPress : \"there's no doubt about that Mrs Glenol but the thing is that you didn't have the privilege she had during undercover ok that's accident but still she was accepted to actually go to the spot and then Kanto and all being properly guided(all laugh..lot)\nDawn(straight) : \"that's because of her career before she was a 7 time champ in first 7 regions all by herself if i had that behind me i would've jumped into undercover too may be cause atleast by means of battling say even 3 on 1 even with boosters but fair rules and no more than 3 trainers each having own pokemon but nine pseudo-legend though all psychic but none pure# you can't win fair battles atleast against me even if don't lose(all laugh..lot)..and definitely not get away from that without further consequences if my bunch has seen Unova 0th hand many having come from exact same valleys like on a contract(all laugh..long)..except for Mr Nofcan none would've beaten her at Kanto including the rest 2 of her siblings at the same rank just cause they didn't see Unova or Undercover first hand and he did it in a 16 minutes very last round case that too his Goodra stood up at 18 Mrs Rarcia's took 6 exact more seconds and no more(all laugh..lot)..the other sibling is Redzep Rafolrat no address inquested#..Red Zaps off Stats,#..hence a rather disturbance psychologically though#..Mr Hum-bertooo 'Nough-on-Stat,#..then at Elite4 challenge she lost only so few rounds no matches barring Mr Marc Litman reasoning unnecessary after the very name(all burst..,..Marc The Mr Litman)..and yeah she lost to Mrs Samantha Rafolrat Karsot best left preoccupied with space due to lack of internal time#..and well about the main difference between she being pampered and me being declined is all cause what i understood much later that i wouldn't be alive physically if i was allowed right after almost 5 long years of Sinnoh# and especially not after the fact that the most of last 2 of which was spent under the guardianship of Jubilee Hands-On# which no matter my wish would've had repercussions in society who don't understand all the intricate nuances of Pokemon Training including researchers and all included the things i've come to know in this journey even Dr Oak i believe didn't know before the Unovan Trouble started 2 years back infact none knew among us now it's public knowledge without the counter which select few can and will know or be given which has been in my case this time(all laugh..lot)..it's tacit knowledge and one has to face say a Heatmore at a volcano bed to really get it(all laugh..lot) but the thing is that it's given to me cause i was told about these there itself by the two persons you mentioned they subsequently only validated themselves at Unova cause that wasn't for learning it was for application it's like death none will listen to our practice or sentiment or life stories there or the fact that i want to look at life once more it's like that the spontaneity there's no knowledge only application which isn't the case if seen closely but that's in terms of self in terms of it's about training and meaning as they've been saying for 41 years now that too constant(all laugh..lot)..and Dr Oak included hence what we had to come across at best through logic he would've only had to recognize which he doesn't need to if he's a professional of specific as you understand Hands-On(all un..)..so as for that matter no i only understood later their actions as did their own other halves and Mrs Poppy Waterflower Ketchum was traveling throughout Unova and Kalos and I don't need to talk about her so if it was a mystery to her what her other half was doing even while traveling with her most definitely it will be to his little sisters who were traveling in different places with misconceptions over communication of being and intention vs contact of soul and information(all laugh..lot)..and unlike any Dr Oak would've been able to understand things just as they appeared as i said this included as he was an apprentice under Jubilee Hands-On upon how to run a lab not being present in the same region for 10 very long years while winning a league after securing 120 pokemons in very first region and having flagged off the beginning of Tyranitar(all laugh..lot)..and i've been under his guidance too except Mrs Gladys Iptil-Ketchum Ortiz and Dr Oak none has had the opportunity to get this and none neither has had the opportunity of being sponsored by him throughout a region for close to 1.75 years that i've had without that i would've been gone to the bushes absolutely i understood this when i insisted that my then boyfriend should chose the party location that i wanted to go to and yeah this was Pasio#..Drew+May..The Imperative Ones,all un..,Dawn too un..#..this wouldn't have been the case either i would've ended up a wreck or physically gone to the wonders of life after death#..so yeah this lifelong faithfulness benefits people neither the objects nor their practice unless for the later they acknowledge what they want and what they're at present doing so yeah you can say in a way they only made sure i know that i was their very own much more than spatiotemporal scales can ever define which if certainly i remembered i would've had an easier journey less wasteful that's all at Hoenn that is where i failed to go out of Birch labs for 5 months then abjectly failing at Pettelesberg then got off for good# but it all is conjecture now and hence implausible to talk about(all laugh..lot) and as for Melody well her case was much more difficult and different to me but again she admits this all time she should've done what i should've too that is travel with any or all of the people that we were suggested to travel with exactly what Mrs Rarcia did after never during undercover#Seth&Mehadi..The Implicit Ones,#,Iris un..,# that or talk with the suggested people among whom also are the exact persons that we both eventually will talk with all our lives as a signed agreement by your consensus law and nothing else(all laugh..lot)..i was forced to travel with my other half but in Melody's case her other half was viciously criticized for getting distracted by his personal life because Melody did travel with the people suggested but refused to talk with her other half the reverse of my situation since#..The Imperative Ones#..\"\nPress : \"well about that Mrs Glenol,Mrs Tirrison's case we all know your case wasn't so after Hoenn so it must be extremely dangerous what you were exposed to in the name of practices at Sinnoh(all burst..)\"\nDawn(straight) : \"well you said the word yourselves (all burst..,Sirichai.. that's a DANGEROUS consequence Sirich retrospectively exactly how Cidu had to leave his job you know,all un..,..The Eureka Ones,all un..) i turned 20 and found myself alone suddenly with confusions all over so i was talking with people whom i only should've spoken with to use lexicon properly(all laugh..lot) then this was on the month that i travelled alone at Sinnoh the final month on which my bros won the league there Uncle Crook# was only looking after my bunch i had a free run to have my cup of famed tea which i completely failed to manage without getting distracted by me of you not you of you or me of me# so before it reached you of me i was preempted from lexicon to be exposed to meanings.. Hands-On#,Dawn..Civilization,#..and yes it was dangerous otherwise if i was alone there in terms of training it always is dangerous to keep a Spinda even as you know Dr Serena Toganne Tomkins' stories of her co-ordinator days at Unova the two months even she with her mercurial career of 23 long years by then couldn't handle(all laugh..lot,Serena bursts..)..\"\nPress : \"yes we acknowledge that but also we hear how she too the very next month after being dragged all over the whole Hoenn and Ransei region for a month got married the very next month so she too was helped in a way only after she attempted to face a not fully tamed Kommo-O with a domesticated Spinda in a contest second round firstly is that the test of courage secondly is that a pattern in this(all burst..,Goran,Seth,Bazugh and Serena un..)..\"\nDawn(straight) : \"no it's not a test of courage it was an act of emergency to preempt her from the mythical Unovan bushes where none goes first up pro or amatuer with even a Marill(all burst..,Itzel&Yagmur..Mr Skechit why you think and do and not do or think so after thinking or doing/thus jumping into ocean with not-self concerned Marill..will be ruing,all un..)..and she wasn't alone but had about 100 of her siblings looking after her day and night infact her other half was the main field referee in that occasion itself by procedural decisions(all laugh..lot) so only there it might've been an act of courage(all burst..,Bazugh and Serena un..)..she couldn't do it alone hence was left not lone as they'd say(all laugh..lot) but we could and we were champs hence our cases were handled differently Mrs Tirrison not going to Hoenn i know for record first hand was a pure case of inter sibling rivalry with our big bro Mr Seth Ketchum taking the side of Dr Oak for a change which none can do as she will tell you first hand(all laugh..lot,Melody..yeah bro..hush now oh being did your attention your notion just poke,all un..long,Melody..thus you said yeah to only catch my attention so that you can refocus your self upon your being..thus feed yes as another thing to in continuation to your thoughts upto the point..to the next point of expectation from the recurring logic to deem secured intellect as bro,all un..long,Melody..no you can't sign for her and push her into anywhere you want..so that somewhere professionally can say the personal what's,all un..long,Melody..Pasio Hush,all un..)..besides my nephews are still unsure if i'm elder to her or the reverse(all laugh..lot,Melody too laughs..lot)..then with this precursor the pattern is familiar that if i disgorge a food you can't make me eat that that was the case in both our cases she did it unknowingly in it's entirety and that was proven by her Frontier journey and the 4 journeys she had her family with her she reached the last step three times one loss against Dr Oak is considered a professional debut to training those who faced him know that like Mrs Riley Rednak Reid has been saying for 27 years constant yeah almost half her life(all laugh..lot)..physical that is(all burst..),and then she had faced Mrs Bujona Eritak in semis in her first region whom we all know about(all laugh..lot,Guang and Gus..Taxi,all laugh..lot) then Melody did the unthinkable here few months short of 20 years back beating first Gladly Syndrome#..then Asset Future then Cassette Capture first understand these terms as humans# then she defeated Fortune Claps then Convene Skats# then lastly she managed to topple Slalom Seldom and Column Jargon consecutively leaving the ball to Unovan courts absolutely as she postponed it for 9 years and most of all saved Mrs Blackmore from University classes on psychology(all laugh..lot,May bursts..)..then she did do that final with me where i didn't know one damn thing as to why i was doing what i was doing except for the fact that i knew that i was doing what was being asked of me to be done by rationality not logic(all burst..)..so there's no credit for me in there and the fact of the matter is i didn't need to go against her i could've done it the month later given i was specially granted to start from the month i did as i was abducted# but that means i would've faced the Intent Drills# rest insured by Mrs Tirrison herself(all burst..,Melody un..)..she never wanted to win unlike what i did and all except Kalos and Unova where she failed to get past Round 64 then barely manager to make it to the finals and i didn't finish even a year in 5 successive regions two of which were Kalos and Unova where i attempted it after 3 majors that's for stats(all laugh..lot)..those two are the hardest regions in terms of the trekking Unova is legendary for the Elusive bushes Kalos for it's unofficial challenges with say a Zygarde against a Magnezone that's inhuman as Dr Jackal noticed still a physical teenager(all un..,Dawn..Tickle Mastery,all un..)..anyway the way i was taught or Mrs Tirrison understood things we needed the daily personal care which we ignored completely cause we were so emotionally attached to our bros we didn't see past that and then had our own incentives Mrs Blackmore was far more infatuated with bro than both me and Melody combined but you see she is a bit shrew thus only there's 1 exact league of her own rest 5 she drew(all burst..,Goran..Hum..Liability!Liberty!Compultion!Workaholism!,all un..long,Drew and May un..long)..so the pattern is like that and yeah all of us sisters were too emotionally attached to bro,Bonnie had to talk with Gorrie each day and never once with her hubby on how to educate her daughter infact her hubby was banished from home as a revenge for not allowing her to travel with her big bros no matter first how old Bambie was with them anything is possible(all burst..,Seth..Hum,Faith!Trust!Sercurity!Dependability!Insurance!,all un..long,Drew and May un..long)..and secondly the fact that she was a 5 time contest winner herself out of 7# she vehemently remonstrated with her hubby though who had same recognition that they didn't know the ELUSIVE 🐉(all laugh..lot) which has absolutely nothing to do with the idea of others only the types of projection what to speak of creatures not breeders(all burst..,Gus..Cili this a KOMMO-O,um..no Sir he meant he once showed Jingie the chance of a certain result in discrete but consecutive dice throws,all un..,Guang.. Probability : the assurance of THE Elusive🐉,all un..,Cilan shakes..)..and the reason is best explained by their respective flowers only and their influences on the likes of Mr Redzep Rafolrat the foremost never elaborated further(all burst..,Goran and Seth..Mr Hummm-Bertoooo 'NUOUGH-ON-STAT..,all un..long,Drew..Culture..,all un..,Goran and Seth un..long) hence during their breakup years just to abide by lexicon# most of their sisters and brothers were also against each other at home only making it clear to them that it made no sense at all(all laugh..lot)..and the reasoning behind is that the inter brothers and inter sisters relationships with them isn't very proper to elaborate in public i know the best i was 17,Lillie flower was 36 not months physically rest never mattered like Lillie flower(all burst..),and Poppy was 33 and we argued each day atleast an hour on hour itself(all laugh..lot,Guang+Itzel&Gus+Yagmur..Daily Daily WaterFire/Hasty Hasty Logic mire,all un..,Goran+Poppy and Seth+Mehadi un..)..and that is why the Waterflower Sisters are known across dimensions as you see their bunches now a days especially Daisy's(all laugh..lot)..they had this this relationship each representative of an ideal which was only the strategies of self consuming oneness hence they all only are variable in terms of subsuming themselves as subsisting not consisting their own path thus their lifelong arguments they don't have enough patience to talk about anything personal among themselves and their hubbies beyond half an hour but that is vehemently insisted upon as part of their scheme which their hubbies wanted to always make either 35 or 25 cause they insist the exact opposite as they can subsume themselves never subsist thus the behaviours where they refuse their soulmates physical presence(all laugh..lot)..so it's about that and still among the sisters it's always about that aspiration but among the brothers it's the distortion hence it's best left in private Mr Blackmore knows this all the more(all laugh..lot)..and why they never faced anything is called with distortions they become a bit shrew thus they find a way to discombobulate personal life by saying we only drew(all un..long,Seth..HUM,Co-Operation!Truth-Full-Ness!

rather than being only us the most copious,all un..long,..Sandie's..in trouble,all un..long)..\"\nDawn(laughing..) : \"well it's a different sector of obsession with relativity,psychology,pertinence etc(all burst..,..Sluis,all burst..)..and it's cause the same reason why the rest of our sisters she defeated in that region Gladie and Poppy out of them Gladie is not famous they're in dictionary for effusiveness compeers you can't drag her down first cause she is thoroughly influenced by those called together as Who-oh-Forlorn rest inferential instantaneously#Dawn..\njab..Who-oh-ringtone/feint..We-ah-Forlorn/clinch..Look at the relation of why and my,#,and about Yumi and Gladie and all they along with that will cease exactly like Lillie flower isn't so as a personnel ever rather just Lillie flower(all laugh..lot,..Lillie flower)..rest are famous cause you can aspire unto them the others are only assimilating ever(all laugh..lot)..it's the same reason why  Mr Weayaya and Haithem Ketchum's works aren't considered in records only as a whole bundle if the 4 it comes discretely only for their biographical mention(all un..long,Cedar..Mercenaries of Dictionary..countering,all un..)..\"\nPress : \"well as we note that there are a all kinds of characters everywhere in your family and their different methods and approaches to this whole profession Mrs Glenol in all this what you all say methods invented by Doctor Brock Slate before he turned 4 years and 7 months after about 9 months of handling pokemons from the age of 3.75 to 4.5 that too ground steel types elaborated by rock(all burst..)..which even Mr Simon says was the reason why he and the rest like Ms Katya and Sakura the most have such an unfathomable range of methods they infact came at the juncture of the previous and new methods and with their own ideas when they started so they really helped establishing this bridge but what are your thoughts on Mrs Skechit's career(all burst..,..DaisyDevil)\"\nDawn(laughing..) : \"well she with everything combined found out the most beautiful style cause beauty comes as discrete it doesn't continue from reasons hence her method is impossible to imitate cause she knows each of those methods helped first hand by Doctor Slate himself who was training himself and had to qualify somehow(all laugh..lot)..so gist as you understand character of simplicity and rest at a go especially if oneness is concerned a serious practitioner can't later and doesn't during vow hide own character hence her style is like that it's incredibly complex to entwine together in matter of seconds and hence eventually her bunch lost interest in attacking or defending but detached understanding thus formulative observation exactly what Dr Jackal advocates for just to spend the days as existence finds them as they'd say(all laugh..lot,..The Fitted Ones,all burst..)..hence you can understand the lack of a contest in each of her matches the only one to go to CoE with that sort of a record 16 years no contests against absolutely anyone including long retired bunches# hence the recognition#..so yeah they both are like that Daisy is most elaborating Dr Skechit obviously most Subtle(all burst..,Gladys..The 🦊 of Facilitation,all un..long)..\"\nPress : \"we recognize that too Mrs Glenol thanks(all burst..)..but in this context we all know how to approach all your siblings again barring Mrs Mehadi only she among all even Mr Seth never left her shield of grace and compassion rest all if asked proper epistemological questions object against it even Mrs Susana Komovo Nalabel who does it physically her words never change in tone or diction(all burst..,Guang+Itzel,Gus+Yagmur,Goran and Seth..Shhooe?,all un..long) but Mrs Mehadi really seems hidden in darkness since she retunred to gym leading before that during travels still she could be caught arguing with people sometimes which never had made any sense as much as her words does as ever if riled up actually down to 5 year olds as the only way to do it is to insinuate about difference(all burst..)\"\nDawn(laughing..) : \"well except for Dr and Mrs Oak none managed that if bro wasn't present with her other times all her sisters and bro-in-laws could if you want to see her real version that is a 4 year old bro is only a rhetoric for idealism# intact you have to ask master brats to help you out if you can approach them on an issue that is especially Orrie(all un..,Cedar..Living Living Living Now/Painting Painting Painting How,#)..with them everyone has remained same except when Sylvia aunty was physically alive from Cerulean# she they considered like their mom hence she as you know had the existence to deal with outside of and thus unlike our mere consciousness universal(all burst..)..thus upto 54 year she had many difficulties#..George uncle never much cause he was treated like a baby just as anyone and everyone else#..\"\nPress : \"yeah we understand the nuances of parenting(all un..)..and the fact that Mr Seth never liked the fact that he had to travel around Unova with his other half physically which was the reverse for the other case(all laugh..lot)..but Mrs Arissu Rarcia is the extroverted version of Mrs Bujona Eritak we get that(all burst..,Iris..Taxi,#) but out of all Mr David Nofcun seems most normal just an extremely talented general trainer and there's no other versions of it like his sibling Mr Redzep in this trait not the substance(all burst..) but this is unlike their mentor Mrs Mehadi(all laugh..lot)..but Mr Nofcun is a great trainer and no more it seems which goes against their rules we guess(all burst..)\"\nDawn(laughing..) : \"well everything to him is the profession compeer he has been going through this so so many times hence the knowledge if you ask him on intention behind any action i'm sure you won't see your own self again only being he's too ingrained with mathematics compeer how's that for axioms(all burst..)\"\nPress : \"we see thanks for your insights Mrs Glenol#..and well another thing is that Mrs Glenol is that how's your relationship with Mrs Waterflower Skechit cause after Sinnoh neither you nor she ever spoke with each other(all burst..,..DaisyDevil)\"\nDawn(laugh) : \"the right word should've been collaborated in terms of necessary indenteties rather than discriminations the observational necessity(all burst..,..DaisyDevil) and well again it's just that she could be accused of conflict of interests and i don't have to say more to enter her office room in reality the central battlefield# anyway# The Waterflower Sisters are like that compeers if you don't recognize their name you don't get anything at all about them the eldest the most in the reverse way(all laugh..lot,..DaisyDevil)\"\nPress : \"thanks and again our fervent wishes(all burst..)..we know how Mrs Waterflower Slate always supported you in public and her younger sister knows no exclusion as far as personalities are concerned only inclusiveness of their profession as being able to be perceptive to decision not that they can decide as personnels cause that's not possible being insentient reference rather the desired profession of sentience(all un..,..Lillie flower) but we don't know much about Mrs Mehadi Waterflower Ketchum's relationship with you ever her life infact since she entered Hoenn \n still remains in dark to public as much as Mr Seth Ketchum's personal life despite they being found together each time(all burst..,Seth+Mehadi un..)..they represent the all devouring game of indifference the most as you said and we don't believe it to be most worthy of aspiring only taking as reference(all burst..,..The Darkened Ones,Seth+Mehadi un..)..we only know all that took place before she never spoke frankly to public after that infact never did after she turned 17.5 and set out for her journey and never did any press on own career after announcing that she'll not become a gym leader due to Daisy changing her mind notwithstanding Dr Skechit(all burst..,Tracey+Daisy un..) all those 19.25 years back from Johto(all laugh..lot)..for Mrs Poppy we all knew as it was written to the press not law due to that being the standard#..that it was irreconcilable inferences(all un..long,..The Pedantic Ones,all un..long,Goran+Poppy un..)..the result was written as essence based continuum alone not presence based optimum#..but we never really understood anything about Mrs Mehadi no matter what she did in public life and all it just doesn't sync well to what she did before 17 and half(all laugh..lot)..those versions of Mr Seth and Mrs Mehadi seems to have just went away like magic..we know that he was most inclined to Ash..(all un..long,David.. semblance Dave between any two discernible thus not analytical objects,all un..long,David.. semblance in meaning thus Dave if you find look expectation now Phantom,all un..long,David..Lastly the Playboy Section,all un..long)..hence we ask this(all un..long,Dawn.. Lastly The Playboy Caption,all un..)..\"\nDawn(laugh) : \"well you have to ask philosophers as to these paradox whatever happened to Ash(all un..long,Dawn..Lastly The Playboy Tension,all un..long)..if Oumou was ever born mathematically(all un..long,Decision hurray executable Tiffin Concur/Else Axiom's perception's Coffin Saunter,all un..long) if Orion actually does what it seems he's doing(all un..long,Living Hunter thus Caution!Painter,all un..long)..and finally if Ushi is at all epistemological truth or ontological apprearance(all un..long,..Premise Ordain,all un..long)..and no none ever found any of them doing anything after they turned 3.5 and before they turned 1.5(all un..long)..that too was all for versioning issues between them(all laugh..lot)..so yeah it's a paradox but the thing is that what Ash did in that span can't be classified as doing either so my conjecture is that there was no such thing as Ash only Ash..collision now Phantom(all un..long,Dawn..Lastly the Playboy Diction,all un..long)..Oumou was never born technically cause that's implausible if decided thus thereby itself ended as per conservation of action and reason behind not goal the end(all un..)..Ushi was never truth or appearance as effort isn't classifiable as either only existent(all burst..) and finally no Orion doesn't do anything that seems cause there's only an algorithm hunting for it's aim nothing to do with it's own claims of consciousness thus(all un..)..anyway(all burst..) about what happened to Colony Monogram you may ask his 8 Tyranitars(all laugh..lot)..and about his Mehu flower well you have to ask mind the word his manager(all laugh..lot)..about my relationship with Mehadi it's that i never had a quarrel even in my subconscious with two persons in this world one is obviously Marc The Mr Litman no more(all burst..,Iris..no Mr and Mrs Rarcia don't leave your offices with a smile in your faces it's confusing as to why you're happy for leaving or for finishing once my Cherrim won a round despite not understanding this differnece between exclusion and consideration and didn't listen to me subsequently hence next 4 rounds lost you know,all un..long,Dawn..yeah i'll drink this too how much do you earn hum,all un..,Itzel&Yagmur..The Entailed Ones,Dawn..it's morning there Dawnny be polite,call has come..Marc The Mr Litman..anything else left out,all un..long) and the second is Mehu flower ofcourse she's best left as that cause the rest isn't controlled by her only her projection manager whom even i couldn't talk with him about her in any details not even just details as he would point out my grammatical mistake of difference(all burst..)..and you can't approach Mehu on him being another but not the other#..Mrs Blackmore knew a bit more cause Mr Blackmore was mercilessly imbibed with these ideas# but absolutely nothing she ever got from bro on his opinions on Mehu being at the same region as him and being with her in Mehu's case# and this is cause Mehu comes from a particular city out of the whole of the world as you know he doesn't like that name cause of it's bias towards the tranquility of water type rather than in his interpretation the robustness of cold in ice types like the very neighbourhood city has which opposes Mehu's idea of water type's elasticity(all laugh..lot,Seth..Cerulean!)..he doesn't like the way the city is planned the way the houses are built the way the practice facilities work and so on he doesn't understand why the common people there behave differently to Accumula his ideal city he tried to sketch here became a town(all laugh..lot)..cause in his world need and entailment has no difference(all un..,Colony Monogram,all un..,Seth too un..)..he was hopeful that rather Mr Stuart McShin will be the gym leader there and Daisy may want to travel with them which both she and each of her siblings so much wanted as you know it would've made absolutely no sense whatsoever#..but Stu objected to this as ethical deceit understand this term first(all un..long,Guang and Gus..Sweet Cute Stu Speaking,all un..)..hence there's this irritation like version controls you see hence Mrs Mehadi Waterflower Ketchum,GoC(7,8),Cerulean,Kanto is completely under self management(all laugh..lot)..infact i knew bro tried to shift her away to specialist post which would've necessitated her stay at Sinnoh rather than Hoenn# but his siblings refused because they were completely blinded by Mehadi's views and ideal and all she's just too big a personality no matter how she appears this all admits barring her husband ofcourse as you know he doesn't like to talk about his personal life with her to start with despite never leaving her alone which isn't liked in reverse hence no sos could ever be found(all burst..,Goran+Poppy..The Darkened Ones,all un..,Seth+Mehadi too un..)\"\nPress : \"well thanks again Mrs Glenol we understand since the beginning that he's ferociously protective of his other half's public image(all laugh..lot)..lastly then are you going to work as a judge or ranger(all laugh..lot)\"\nDawn(laughing..) : \"well it's so fitting compeers that my travelling career ends like this with this note cause i started with this question of actions and habits and practice of self unbinding to Simile Popcorn who as you mentioned the word referred me to Lastly Phantom and thus i began he'd say to elaborate not actuate..(all burst..)..(all un..) so i'll end with this too what i do next look tense says Phantom..anything else countering?(all burst..)..(all un..,Iris and Dawn..Lastly The

we're only trying to understand the grim part of your career Mrs Glenol the start was incomparable the end has been impossible(all laugh..lot)..and these two moments itself has fetched you 4 Majors

the match after the annihilation in each round of whole first half# that was a great match no matter being like amateur vs pro-legend human trainers we mean#..and again Mr Bugpoi no matter the

Slate's presence in the initial 6 months of your contest Frontier journey there cause he too didn't like everything that was happening around hence only Mr Zed was with you throughout rest out of reach for tense#Dawn..Jubilee Hands-On#..but we understand your attachment to your elder siblings anyone would simply from the professional aspect itself#..but after your 5th consecutive disqualification is fastest time none in the world knew where you were barring your family who obviously weren't worried even remotely because you were with your other half only as later revealed# but we understand upto Kalos after that the the Ransei and Pasio journey of Ms Berlitz is what's really confusing to us Mrs Glenol because you travelled with the same person with whom you travelled the next at Kanto and won the contest there and this is the same person whom you're traveling with now too albeit mentally(all laugh..lot)..but then it was absurd the way things developed there in comparison to say Mr Javier and Mrs Susana#..\"\nDawn(laughing..) : \"well i can say me and my hubby had far more fun together for 1.5 years than them they only had examples which they either had to

thing compeers it's not impossible again it's just not attainable(all burst..) and the reason is neither my bunch nor i had to do anything here at all it was our pleasure and privilege to be able to

agree Mrs Glenol(all burst..) but in that way as you said you were gifted 3 major titles another your bunch had nothing to do with emotionally#.. and all this was so that you can win this one your

beyond her physical existence hence they should ask this question after she's gone may be tomorrow and no more can i say except that she wasn't involved in profession then her bunch wasn't there with her she was doing some nasty things namely drinking energy drinks all day and continuing to do mentations just to take a revenge upon her physique while strengthening her mental metabolism#Goran..Incentive Overdose,all un..,Poppy too un..# but they only affected her and she stayed at a resort which was the property of Mr Kumaglak Kunilak whose her little bro who employed two dedicated staffs to look after her who were only Mr Victor 'Vickie' Xarar and Mrs Hannah Halmsley Xarar who were among the foremost of people(all burst..,Guang,Gus,Goran and Poppy and Seth and Mehadi

Flower if that being decided to do something unless for her involution as you understand hence it was the best optimization indeed(all laugh..lot)..besides Mr and Mrs Xarar were there cause they were remonstrating against the Elite4 journey of particularly Mr Seth Ketchum not Mr Goran Ketchum he only had a situation with his own other half Mr Seth's issues were multiversal whole world knows him and his other half by now as an eroteme#..The Darkened Ones,#..as for Poppy flower well why that being would want to do that it was only the testing of existense of the involution that she was trying

flower is completely beyond me#\"\nPress : \"perfectly comprehensive Mrs Glenol thanks(all burst..) but one thing is still unclear Mrs Glenol is that in case of Mrs Tirrison she never was a travel companion of your mentors and the others who have been are in the gym leader's positions at various cities who travelled at all the regions among them most were the followers of either Mr Guang Ketchum or Mr Goran Ketchum who were hosted by Focal Bludgeon and Daily Hologram the foremost and latest among the most esoteric ones(all laugh..lot)..so does it imply anything as to that they made sure you couldn't do it without them first#.. your career will be over exactly when they wanted to employ you at the 23 cities secondly# and in case of Mr and Mrs Blackmore they weren't what you were

when they started Pasio i was still in elementary not even in second year(all laugh..lot) and i had not much interest as you all know about the second Mr and Mrs Blackmore picked what we did later and

theirs how would you categorize my case(all laugh..lot)\"\nPress : \"well your case was an opportunity as was Mr and Mrs Blackmore's unlike say Mr Salusar and Mrs Rarcia(all laugh..lot)..then Mrs Tirrison did travel finally with you all at Sinnoh but you were refused at 2 whole regions the second of which is very difficult to comprehend from our part on their actions throughout(all laugh..lot)\"\nDawn(straight) : \"all of our cases were opportunities and there's a trend in recent times to take Mrs Rarcia for granted i'm sure we all know her full career right especially the Kanto League final and the Elite4 challenge and what her current official rank is and the fact that she along with her other half who is also in all time HoF and also saw out undercover and lived for Unovan Bushes reloaded(all laugh..lot) they have personally been selected as vice head and personal secretary by Marc The Mr Litman..rest unnecessary(all laugh..lot,Iris..no Mr and Mrs Rarcia when you finish your sentences don't say that's all say this is the gist of what i feel as else it makes you preempt from the conversation cause you can't add further you're neither concentrated to listen nor to finish nor interested to go further in the subject compeers once my Scizor failed to provide a trap only a coy due this not understanding this thus lost 3 rounds you know despite the toss of starting the plan,all un..long,Iris..Marc the Mr Litman no more options required,all un..)..\"\nPress : \"there's no doubt about that Mrs Glenol but the thing is that you didn't have the privilege she had during undercover ok that's accident but still she was accepted to actually go to the spot and then Kanto and all being properly guided(all laugh..lot)\nDawn(straight) : \"that's because of her career before she was a 7 time champ in first 7 regions all by herself if i had that behind me i would've jumped into undercover too may be cause atleast by means of battling say even 3 on 1 even with boosters but fair rules and no more than 3 trainers each having own pokemon but nine pseudo-legend though all psychic but none pure# you can't win fair battles atleast against me even if don't lose(all laugh..lot)..and definitely not get away from that without further consequences if my bunch has seen Unova 0th hand many having come from exact same valleys like on a contract(all laugh..long)..except for Mr Nofcan none would've beaten her at Kanto including the rest 2 of her siblings at the same rank just cause they didn't see Unova or Undercover first hand and he did it in a 16 minutes very last round case that too his Goodra stood up at 18 Mrs Rarcia's took 6 exact more seconds and no more(all laugh..lot)..the other sibling is Redzep Rafolrat no address inquested#..Red Zaps off Stats,#..hence a rather disturbance psychologically though#..Mr Hum-bertooo 'Nough-on-Stat,#..then at Elite4 challenge she lost only so few rounds no matches barring Mr Marc Litman reasoning unnecessary after the very name(all burst..,..Marc The Mr Litman)..and yeah she lost to Mrs Samantha Rafolrat Karsot best left preoccupied with space due to lack of internal time#..and well about the main difference between she being pampered and me being declined is all cause what i understood much later that i wouldn't be alive physically if i was allowed right after almost 5 long years of Sinnoh# and especially not after the fact that the most of last 2 of which was spent under the guardianship of Jubilee Hands-On# which no matter my wish would've had repercussions in society who don't understand all the intricate nuances of Pokemon Training including researchers and all included the things i've come to know in this journey even Dr Oak i believe didn't know before the Unovan Trouble started 2 years back infact none knew among us now it's public knowledge without the counter which select few can and will know or be given which has been in my case this time(all laugh..lot)..it's tacit knowledge and one has to face say a Heatmore at a volcano bed to really get it(all laugh..lot) but the thing is that it's given to me cause i was told about these there itself by the two persons you mentioned they subsequently only validated themselves at Unova cause that wasn't for learning it was for application it's like death none will listen to our practice or sentiment or life stories there or the fact that i want to look at life once more it's like that the spontaneity there's no knowledge only application which isn't the case if seen closely but that's in terms of self in terms of it's about training and meaning as they've been saying for 41 years now that too constant(all laugh..lot)..and Dr Oak included hence what we had to come across at best through logic he would've only had to recognize which he doesn't need to if he's a professional of specific as you understand Hands-On(all un..)..so as for that matter no i only understood later their actions as did their own other halves and Mrs Poppy Waterflower Ketchum was traveling throughout Unova and Kalos and I don't need to talk about her so if it was a mystery to her what her other half was doing even while traveling with her most definitely it will be to his little sisters who were traveling in different places with misconceptions over communication of being and intention vs contact of soul and information(all laugh..lot)..and unlike any Dr Oak would've been able to understand things just as they appeared as i said this included as he was an apprentice under Jubilee Hands-On upon how to run a lab not being present in the same region for 10 very long years while winning a league after securing 120 pokemons in very first region and having flagged off the beginning of Tyranitar(all laugh..lot)..and i've been under his guidance too except Mrs Gladys Iptil-Ketchum Ortiz and Dr Oak none has had the opportunity to get this and none neither has had the opportunity of being sponsored by him throughout a region for close to 1.75 years that i've had without that i would've been gone to the bushes absolutely i understood this when i insisted that my then boyfriend should chose the party location that i wanted to go to and yeah this was Pasio#..Drew+May..The Imperative Ones,all un..,Dawn too un..#..this wouldn't have been the case either i would've ended up a wreck or physically gone to the wonders of life after death#..so yeah this lifelong faithfulness benefits people neither the objects nor their practice unless for the later they acknowledge what they want and what they're at present doing so yeah you can say in a way they only made sure i know that i was their very own much more than spatiotemporal scales can ever define which if certainly i remembered i would've had an easier journey less wasteful that's all at Hoenn that is where i failed to go out of Birch labs for 5 months then abjectly failing at Pettelesberg then got off for good# but it all is conjecture now and hence implausible to talk about(all laugh..lot) and as for Melody well her case was much more difficult and different to me but again she admits this all time she should've done what i should've too that is travel with any or all of the people that we were suggested to travel with exactly what Mrs Rarcia did after never during undercover#Seth&Mehadi..The Implicit Ones,#,Iris un..,# that or talk with the suggested people among whom also are the exact persons that we both eventually will talk with all our lives as a signed agreement by your consensus law and nothing else(all laugh..lot)..i was forced to travel with my other half but in Melody's case her other half was viciously criticized for getting distracted by his personal life because Melody did travel with the people suggested but refused to talk with her other half the reverse of my situation since#..The Imperative Ones#..\"\nPress : \"well about that Mrs Glenol,Mrs Tirrison's case we all know your case wasn't so after Hoenn so it must be extremely dangerous what you were exposed to in the name of practices at Sinnoh(all burst..)\"\nDawn(straight) : \"well you said the word yourselves (all burst..,Sirichai.. that's a DANGEROUS consequence Sirich retrospectively exactly how Cidu had to leave his job you know,all un..,..The Eureka Ones,all un..) i turned 20 and found myself alone suddenly with confusions all over so i was talking with people whom i only should've spoken with to use lexicon properly(all laugh..lot) then this was on the month that i travelled alone at Sinnoh the final month on which my bros won the league there Uncle Crook# was only looking after my bunch i had a free run to have my cup of famed tea which i completely failed to manage without getting distracted by me of you not you of you or me of me# so before it reached you of me i was preempted from lexicon to be exposed to meanings.. Hands-On#,Dawn..Civilization,#..and yes it was dangerous otherwise if i was alone there in terms of training it always is dangerous to keep a Spinda even as you know Dr Serena Toganne Tomkins' stories of her co-ordinator days at Unova the two months even she with her mercurial career of 23 long years by then couldn't handle(all laugh..lot,Serena bursts..)..\"\nPress : \"yes we acknowledge that but also we hear how she too the very next month after being dragged all over the whole Hoenn and Ransei region for a month got married the very next month so she too was helped in a way only after she attempted to face a not fully tamed Kommo-O with a domesticated Spinda in a contest second round firstly is that the test of courage secondly is that a pattern in this(all burst..,Goran,Seth,Bazugh and Serena un..)..\"\nDawn(straight) : \"no it's not a test of courage it was an act of emergency to preempt her from the mythical Unovan bushes where none goes first up pro or amatuer with even a Marill(all burst..,Itzel&Yagmur..Mr Skechit why you think and do and not do or think so after thinking or doing/thus jumping into ocean with not-self concerned Marill..will be ruing,all un..)..and she wasn't alone but had about 100 of her siblings looking after her day and night infact her other half was the main field referee in that occasion itself by procedural decisions(all laugh..lot) so only there it might've been an act of courage(all burst..,Bazugh and Serena un..)..she couldn't do it alone hence was left not lone as they'd say(all laugh..lot) but we could and we were champs hence our cases were handled differently Mrs Tirrison not going to Hoenn i know for record first hand was a pure case of inter sibling rivalry with our big bro Mr Seth Ketchum taking the side of Dr Oak for a change which none can do as she will tell you first hand(all laugh..lot,Melody..yeah bro..hush now oh being did your attention your notion just poke,all un..long,Melody..thus you said yeah to only catch my attention so that you can refocus your self upon your being..thus feed yes as another thing to in continuation to your thoughts upto the point..to the next point of expectation from the recurring logic to deem secured intellect as bro,all un..long,Melody..no you can't sign for her and push her into anywhere you want..so that somewhere professionally can say the personal what's,all un..long,Melody..Pasio Hush,all un..)..besides my nephews are still unsure if i'm elder to her or the reverse(all laugh..lot,Melody too laughs..lot)..then with this precursor the pattern is familiar that if i disgorge a food you can't make me eat that that was the case in both our cases she did it unknowingly in it's entirety and that was proven by her Frontier journey and the 4 journeys she had her family with her she reached the last step three times one loss against Dr Oak is considered a professional debut to training those who faced him know that like Mrs Riley Rednak Reid has been saying for 27 years constant yeah almost half her life(all laugh..lot)..physical that is(all burst..),and then she had faced Mrs Bujona Eritak in semis in her first region whom we all know about(all laugh..lot,Guang and Gus..Taxi,all laugh..lot) then Melody did the unthinkable here few months short of 20 years back beating first Gladly Syndrome#..then Asset Future then Cassette Capture first understand these terms as humans# then she defeated Fortune Claps then Convene Skats# then lastly she managed to topple Slalom Seldom and Column Jargon consecutively leaving the ball to Unovan courts absolutely as she postponed it for 9 years and most of all saved Mrs Blackmore from University classes on psychology(all laugh..lot,May bursts..)..then she did do that final with me where i didn't know one damn thing as to why i was doing what i was doing except for the fact that i knew that i was doing what was being asked of me to be done by rationality not logic(all burst..)..so there's no credit for me in there and the fact of the matter is i didn't need to go against her i could've done it the month later given i was specially granted to start from the month i did as i was abducted# but that means i would've faced the Intent Drills# rest insured by Mrs Tirrison herself(all burst..,Melody un..)..she never wanted to win unlike what i did and all except Kalos and Unova where she failed to get past Round 64 then barely manager to make it to the finals and i didn't finish even a year in 5 successive regions two of which were Kalos and Unova where i attempted it after 3 majors that's for stats(all laugh..lot)..those two are the hardest regions in terms of the trekking Unova is legendary for the Elusive bushes Kalos for it's unofficial challenges with say a Zygarde against a Magnezone that's inhuman as Dr Jackal noticed still a physical teenager(all un..,Dawn..Tickle Mastery,all un..)..anyway the way i was taught or Mrs Tirrison understood things we needed the daily personal care which we ignored completely cause we were so emotionally attached to our bros we didn't see past that and then had our own incentives Mrs Blackmore was far more infatuated with bro than both me and Melody combined but you see she is a bit shrew thus only there's 1 exact league of her own rest 5 she drew(all burst..,Goran..Hum..Liability!Liberty!Compultion!Workaholism!,all un..long,Drew and May un..long)..so the pattern is like that and yeah all of us sisters were too emotionally attached to bro,Bonnie had to talk with Gorrie each day and never once with her hubby on how to educate her daughter infact her hubby was banished from home as a revenge for not allowing her to travel with her big bros no matter first how old Bambie was with them anything is possible(all burst..,Seth..Hum,Faith!Trust!Sercurity!Dependability!Insurance!,all un..long,Drew and May un..long)..and secondly the fact that she was a 5 time contest winner herself out of 7# she vehemently remonstrated with her hubby though who had same recognition that they didn't know the ELUSIVE 🐉(all laugh..lot) which has absolutely nothing to do with the idea of others only the types of projection what to speak of creatures not breeders(all burst..,Gus..Cili this a KOMMO-O,um..no Sir he meant he once showed Jingie the chance of a certain result in discrete but consecutive dice throws,all un..,Guang.. Probability : the assurance of THE Elusive🐉,all un..,Cilan shakes..)..and the reason is best explained by their respective flowers only and their influences on the likes of Mr Redzep Rafolrat the foremost never elaborated further(all burst..,Goran and Seth..Mr Hummm-Bertoooo 'NUOUGH-ON-STAT..,all un..long,Drew..Culture..,all un..,Goran and Seth un..long) hence during their breakup years just to abide by lexicon# most of their sisters and brothers were also against each other at home only making it clear to them that it made no sense at all(all laugh..lot)..and the reasoning behind is that the inter brothers and inter sisters relationships with them isn't very proper to elaborate in public i know the best i was 17,Lillie flower was 36 not months physically rest never mattered like Lillie flower(all burst..),and Poppy was 33 and we argued each day atleast an hour on hour itself(all laugh..lot,Guang+Itzel&Gus+Yagmur..Daily Daily WaterFire/Hasty Hasty Logic mire,all un..,Goran+Poppy and Seth+Mehadi un..)..and that is why the Waterflower Sisters are known across dimensions as you see their bunches now a days especially Daisy's(all laugh..lot)..they had this this relationship each representative of an ideal which was only the strategies of self consuming oneness hence they all only are variable in terms of subsuming themselves as subsisting not consisting their own path thus their lifelong arguments they don't have enough patience to talk about anything personal among themselves and their hubbies beyond half an hour but that is vehemently insisted upon as part of their scheme which their hubbies wanted to always make either 35 or 25 cause they insist the exact opposite as they can subsume themselves never subsist thus the behaviours where they refuse their soulmates physical presence(all laugh..lot)..so it's about that and still among the sisters it's always about that aspiration but among the brothers it's the distortion hence it's best left in private Mr Blackmore knows this all the more(all laugh..lot)..and why they never faced anything is called with distortions they become a bit shrew thus they find a way to discombobulate personal life by saying we only drew(all un..long,Seth..HUM,Co-Operation!Truth-Full-Ness! Discussion!Perseverance!Fortitude!Hoensty!Loyalty!Morality!Optimism!Assurance!,#,Goran..Recycling the whole of this EACH TIME THERE'S an disagreement! different opinions!dissent!OUTRAGE!,all un..long,Drew and May un..long)..so yeah that's the pattern and if we do our job properly it's going to repeat again next gen(all laugh..lot)..\"\nPress : \"thanks for the detailed clarification Mrs Glenol(all burst..) but from your surmise it seems that Dr Glenol was sent to Flexdijon in that turmoil with an attempt of heist there by the runaway Unova Purge Group so if that's their relationships

long past the sentiment that you were only presented as such by certain substances and hence afterwards your life was in shambles now he says jokingly that he was so glad that you weren't ok mentally

mentors and all seemes to have finally dissapread for good for the rest of next generation atleast and we hold this factor down to the in their words eloquence of the Riumina herd there at Oak Labs

the age of 3.75 to 4.5 that too ground steel types elaborated by rock(all burst..)..which even Mr Simon says was the reason why he and the rest like Ms Katya and Sakura the most have such an

your thoughts on Mrs Skechit's career(all burst..,..DaisyDevil)\"\nDawn(laughing..) : \"well she with everything combined found out the most beautiful style cause beauty comes as discrete it doesn't continue from reasons hence her method is impossible to imitate cause she knows each of those methods helped first hand by Doctor Slate himself who was training himself and had to qualify somehow(all

her style is like that it's incredibly complex to entwine together in matter of seconds and hence eventually her bunch lost interest in attacking or defending but detached understanding thus formulative observation exactly what Dr Jackal advocates for just to spend the days as existence finds them as they'd say(all laugh..lot,..The Fitted Ones,all burst..)..hence you can understand the lack of a contest in each of her matches the only one to go to CoE with that sort of a record 16 years no contests against absolutely anyone including long retired bunches# hence the recognition#..so

just details as he would point out my grammatical mistake of difference(all burst..)..and you can't approach Mehu on him being another but not the other#..Mrs Blackmore knew a bit more cause Mr Blackmore was mercilessly imbibed with these ideas# but absolutely nothing she ever got from bro on his opinions on Mehu being at the same region as him and being with her in Mehu's case# and this is cause Mehu comes from a particular city out of the whole of the world as you know he doesn't like that name cause of it's bias towards the tranquility of water type rather than in his interpretation the robustness of cold in ice types like the very neighbourhood city has which opposes Mehu's idea of water type's elasticity(all laugh..lot,Seth..Cerulean!)..he doesn't like the way the city is planned the way the houses are built the way the practice facilities work and so on he doesn't understand why the common people there behave differently to Accumula his ideal city he tried to sketch here became a town(all laugh..lot)..cause in his world need and entailment has no difference(all un..,Colony Monogram,all un..,Seth too un..)..he was hopeful that rather Mr Stuart McShin will be the gym leader there and Daisy may want to travel with them which both she and each of her siblings so much wanted as you know it would've made absolutely no sense whatsoever#..but Stu objected to this as ethical deceit understand this term first(all un..long,Guang and Gus..Sweet Cute Stu Speaking,all un..)..hence there's this irritation like version controls you see hence Mrs Mehadi Waterflower Ketchum,GoC(7,8),Cerulean,Kanto is completely under self management(all laugh..lot)..infact i knew bro tried to shift her away to specialist post which would've necessitated her stay at Sinnoh rather than Hoenn# but his siblings refused because they were completely blinded by Mehadi's views and ideal and all she's just too big a personality no matter how she appears this all admits barring her husband ofcourse as you know he doesn't like to talk about his personal life with her to start with despite never leaving her alone which isn't liked in reverse hence no sos could ever be found(all burst..,Goran+Poppy..The Darkened Ones,all un..,Seth+Mehadi too un..)\"\nPress : \"well thanks again Mrs Glenol we understand since the beginning that he's ferociously protective of his other half's public image(all laugh..lot)..lastly then are you going to work as a judge or ranger(all laugh..lot)\"\nDawn(laughing..) : \"well it's so fitting compeers that my travelling career ends like this with this note cause i started with this question of actions and habits and practice of self unbinding to Simile Popcorn who as you mentioned the word referred me to Lastly Phantom and thus i began he'd say to elaborate not actuate..(all burst..)..(all un..) so i'll end with this too what i do next look tense says Phantom..anything else countering?(all burst..)..(all un..,Iris and Dawn..Lastly The

wanted to go to either Burgundyreck or Stonegarnet..shh..so Wanting..but they'll walk out of Silver Jubilee Circle they said starting a big upheaval at whole Kanto and Johto will jump in it as i heard as they and Hoenn are in collusion to take away Kanto's name in the interregional circle from 3 to 4 and Kanto has to stand alone cause their partner is Pasio as i heard who taking advantage of nature facilitates those with features..oh so demure..shh..so much commitment..anyway Burgundyreck and Stonegarnet will get out of this circle if anyone who can use a peek-a-boo defence despite more than 10 foot height comes up hence.. strange this physique compeers energy is preserved against nerves yet the mass against emotions..shh..so many varieties..hence i came here when i walked in this building some people wanted my identity rational though they meant yet they asked for a physical proof such a wonder so much generosity..then i was going away as i couldn't satisfy them despite being present..but then i tell you compeers..i could feel it come it's in the air right now..honesty sough..washroom as i said where i know how/and i've been waitin' this moment for all me life..alas spontaneity how..vulture boo validatory consciousness now..hence i went back and asked them if they had a washroom out of the compound they said we never thought of it but i heard..Guzzlord#!..can you feel it think it's in the air of though..of hmm now.. vultures existence you plough\n..so i told them this..they said it's ok you can do it here showed me a place where i went and said all these thoughts there itself when they said you may get in as we thought we will send you in if you polluted the place as a convict but now you've polluted out sentience hence you're an outlaw now hence i came in..meanwhile a few others were there they said they commited this and than abnormalities so i asked did they work..those people said yeah i said then you can defend yourself as being to self..then the guards along with them vehemently remonstrated saying i was instigating perjury of caution..i said yeah i felt so to but then what how to go there to start with..then they kicked me inside used a few hard surfaced metals though the constituents told hallow being as you fiction or mental..decision wise we meant in terms of reaction..so i said rather i'm a conviction of definition..alas..the most sudden..thus no testament only ladden..shh.. conspicuously to burden..anyway then those guards and all protested against officials saying this is oppression of logic..hence i was to be removed from there i said but that's the proof of logic's present the magic..then next moment they pushed me in this meeting i told them to open the door they said no you break it but i found it open compeers just cause you were confirmed being behind it..so i came through the door they remonstrated malfunctioned intentionally..though it only told me greetings convicted one..are you wondering convicted one are you wondering if you could or that you are thus..then i came here and you asked me to explain why i was here but if only you listened to me compeer..shh..the most
